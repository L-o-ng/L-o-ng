Hi, I'm Long. I write in C# and a bit of C++, making Unity games/apps mostly. I also know how to use blender and (try to) do a bit of pixelart. You can find the 2 main projects I've been working on at https://github.com/Into-The-Maze. Into the maze itself is no longer being updated but the game will be restarted later (after we release Arkanyx on itch).
